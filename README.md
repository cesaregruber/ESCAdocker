# ESCAdocker
# Manual
ESCAdocker was created to improve reproducibly of ESCA pipeline. We have exported this conda environment file in a newly created repository named "escaenv".

If you have conda environment management system already installed in your system, let's download the file condaESCAenvironment.yml in your PC, then

$ conda env create -f condaESCAenvironment.yml

$ conda activate escaenv

Otherwise, if you don't have conda already installed in you PC let's see at :
